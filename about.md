Hi! Welcome to my site!

### About me

I first started looking into security when I discovered hacking back in high school. Since then I have participated in forumns, conferences, and meetups to get to know other tech professionals, and participated in CTFs to learn and practice new skills.

My professional experience includes co op placements for tech support, secuirty compliance and devops. My full time experiences includes being a Site Reliability Engineer and Security Operations Engineer. 

My passion in cyber security is offensive security, and I spent my studying periods learning more about it. I enjoyed working on HackTheBox and learning more about OSINT for the [Tracelab](https://www.tracelabs.org/) CTF.

Other cool things I've done:

Volnteered as a Blue Team Mentor for the THE CANADIAN COLLEGIATE CYBER EXERCISE (C3X) Red Forest Competition in 2019. 

My team was the winner of the DC416 CTF: Virtual Threat Defense - Hybrid Cloud Edition.  

Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) Certified

On my spare time, I enjoyed doing martial arts and playing video games
